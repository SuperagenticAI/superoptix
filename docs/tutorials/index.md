# 🎓 Tutorials

Welcome to the SuperOptiX tutorials! These step-by-step guides will take you from complete beginner to building sophisticated AI agents and orchestras.

## 🚀 Getting Started Tutorials

### 🎯 [Quick Start Workflow](../quick-start)

**Perfect for beginners.** Build your first agent and run compile/evaluate/optimize.

**What you'll learn:**
- Initialize a SuperOptiX project
- Pull and compile an agent
- Compile and understand the agent pipeline
- Set up for evaluation and optimization

**Time:** 10-15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Prerequisites:** None

### 🔧 [OpenAI SDK + GEPA Optimization](openai-sdk-gepa-optimization)

**Build custom agents with native OpenAI SDK.** Create a code reviewer using official OpenAI Agents SDK patterns and optimize it with GEPA.

**What you'll learn:**
- Write agents using official OpenAI SDK patterns
- Integrate native SDK agents with SuperOptiX
- Define BDD test scenarios for measurable metrics
- Run GEPA optimization to improve performance
- Implement automatic optimization loading

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Intermediate
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, Ollama installed

### 🎭 [Multi-Agent Orchestra](first-orchestra)

**Advanced tutorial** - Coordinate multiple agents to solve complex problems.

**What you'll learn:**
- Design multi-agent workflows
- Implement agent communication
- Handle complex orchestration scenarios
- Deploy real-world systems

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Advanced
**Prerequisites:** First Agent Tutorial
